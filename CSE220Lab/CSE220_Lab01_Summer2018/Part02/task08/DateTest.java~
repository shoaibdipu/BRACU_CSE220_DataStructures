/*      
Task 8
Create a class called Date that includes three pieces of information as instance 
variables a month (type int), a day (type int) and a year (type int). 
Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables
and assumes that the values provided are correct. Provide a set and a get method 
for each instance variable. Provide a method displayDate that displays the month,
day and year separated by forward slashes (/). 
Write a test application named DateTest that demonstrates class Date's capabilities.
